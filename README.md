Evaluating Code Refactorings

## 1. Materials Provided

You will be given a set of files for each example case:

* **`original_programs.py`**: This file contains a set of 3 distinct Python programs, each presented with its corresponding problem description/query. This represents the "before" state.
* **`v1.py`**: This file presents the first refactoring approach. It includes:
    * The 3 refactored versions of the original programs.
    * A "library" section (e.g., `codebank.py` or inline) containing helper functions. These helper functions might be retrieved from an existing common library or newly created during this refactoring.
    * Either the retrieved or the new helper function sections may be _empty_, in case no programs existed in the codebank at the time or if no need helper functions were created by the LLM.
* **`v2.py`**: This file presents the second, alternative refactoring approach. Similar to `refactoring_v1.py`, it includes:
    * The 3 refactored versions of the original programs (using a different strategy than v1).
    * A "library" section with its own set of helper functions.


**NOTE**:  both refactorings had accuracy at least as good as the original programs.

## 2. Your Task

Your primary task is to:

1.  **Review** the `original_programs.py` to understand the initial code and the problems being solved.
2.  **Analyze** both `refactoring_v1.py` and `refactoring_v2.py`. Pay close attention to how the original programs have been restructured and what functionalities have been extracted into their respective libraries.
3.  **Decide which refactoring (Version 1 or Version 2) you believe is "better,"** based on the evaluation criteria provided below (or your own criteria!).

## 3. Evaluation Criteria: What to Consider for Your Choice

When comparing `refactoring_v1.py` and `refactoring_v2.py`, please *consider* the following aspects to inform your choice. The "better" refactoring should ideally excel in these areas:

> Most importantly, make sure that the extracted functions are **actually reusable and not too specific.** If the main programs are short, the refactoring is not immediately "better"! Try to think whether the extracted functions could actually be used in a different program down the line.

* **Reusability of Helper Functions :**
    * **Generality:** Are the new helper functions general-purpose and potentially useful for *other, different* programs and problems beyond the three presented?
    * **Reuse:** How much were existing helper functions reused?
    * **Specificity:** Are the functions too specialized to the current set of problems, limiting their broader applicability? _Avoid functions that are essentially just the original program broken out into a "helper."_
    * Composability
* **Maintainability:**
    * Readability & Understandability
    * Ease of Modification
    * Separation of Concerns

## 4. What NOT to Focus On:

* **Comments:** Please disregard the presence or absence of comments in the code for this evaluation. These are superficially generated by LLMs in some occasions and could be added manually after with a single pass.
* **Minor Stylistic Differences:** Do not focus on trivial differences in variable naming or formatting, unless they significantly impact readability or understanding.

## 5. How to Provide Your Feedback

For each example case, please provide:

1.  **Your Preferred Version:** (e.g., "Version 1" or "Version 2")
